## Command Line Options
-f      the XLSX spreadsheet to read from
-c      use this if the program is to be repetitively called by a cron job (needs -s option)
-s      the name of the status file to use to keep track of what day the program is option

(-m and -d not implemented yet)

java -jar target\Groundhog-1.0-SNAPSHOT-spring-boot.jar -f "..\Scrum Teams.xlsx" -c -s ..\a.txt

If you do not use the -c option then the program will attempt to sit in a sleep loop being woken up
every (24 hours at) 3 in the morning.

If you do, then the program will attempt to make (and initialise) the file in the directory it is running in with the name you 
supply. If it cannot, then it will fail completely

The program will attempt to prompt you for the right info in the spreadsheet, but if it can't work it out,
then you will need to refer to the example one in this repo. The logs are sent out using Sytem.out from Java - wherever
that might go in your system.....
